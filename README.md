This is the "kean_database" from the SQL phpMyAdmin server. Make sure to import this database into your WampServer. If you haven't installed WampServer yet, you can download it from the link below:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/?authuser=0

Once you've downloaded and installed WampServer, open the application and wait a few moments for it to start. When it's ready, you should see a green icon with a "W" in your system tray (the "hidden icons" area). Click the icon and select phpMyAdmin.

This will open phpMyAdmin in your browser. The default login credentials are:

Username: root
Password: (leave this blank)
After logging in, you will be redirected to the phpMyAdmin dashboard. At the top of the page, you'll see an "Import" button located between the "Export" and "Settings" buttons. Click on Import.

In the "File to Import" section, click Choose File, then find and select the kean_database.sql file you downloaded.

Once the file is uploaded, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Go" button to import the database.

That's it! You're all set up. Good luck!
